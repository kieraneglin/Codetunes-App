### CodeTunez App

This is an app to catalog, organize, and correctly label your music.  If there is any missing information (Eg: missing art, album year, artist, etc,.) it will be corrected and displayed.

### This app is in pre-alpha

There are bugs and oddities.  It doesn't like non-latin characters.  It also doesn't like corrupted MP3 files.  These will be fixed in time, so please be patient.
